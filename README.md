# GMTK 2024 GameJam


Morning dawns in the city. The police are on high alert. A strange, hungry creature roams the streets. They call it...

# CARJU

---

Put the pedal to the metal and floor it right down to Munchytown! Smash into the environment to feed Carju yummy detritus. The Trashmeter needs fuel to get Carju going. The larger he grows, the more you can smash! But make sure to pick up plenty of fuel, and watch out for cops!
